course:
  # A new line or a space separated list of email addresses of course
  # administrative users. Each email address must be placed between '[' and ']',
  # for example: '[test@example.com]'. Regular expressions are not supported,
  # exact match only.

  # Course title
  title: 'Power Searching with Google'

  # Main page blurb. (The '|' at the beginning enables multi-line input.)
  blurb: |
    Google Search makes it amazingly easy to find information. Come learn about
    the powerful advanced tools we provide to help you find just the right
    information when the stakes are high.

  # Information about the instructor to display on the main page.
  instructor_details: 'Daniel Russell <br> Senior Research Scientist <br> Google, Inc.'

  # You can choose whether you want a video or an image on the main page.
  # If you specify a URL for a YouTube video then the video will be displayed
  # in a video player. Otherwide the URL will be shown as an image. The image
  # alt text allows the image to be understood by text-only screen readers.

  # Google Analytics tag: Fill this in with a value obtained by signing up

  # use Google Tag Manager, which can forward event notifications to Google
  # Analytics, as well as to any other user-activity-watcher you like.
  # Change the value below to replace the '#' with the full text of your
  # individual ID number, which will start with 'UA-'.  When set, pages will
  # notify Google Analytics that they have loaded.  See views/base.html.

  # If this tag is not present, boilerplate JavaScript to notify Google
  # Analytics is not emitted.  Not having a value here is harmless.

  # Google Tag Manager ID: Fill this in with a value obtained by signing up
  # at http://www.google.com/tagmanager.  When this ID is present, pages will
  # notify the tag manager (see views/base.html).  This will load a script
  # from Tag Manager which can then emit notifications to other user activity
  # trackers.  This neatly decouples changes to the source code of your
  # course and CourseBuilder deployment from whatever tracking analytics
  # you wish to perform.  (Note that if you wish to track activities more
  # granular than page loads, you will need to mark up your course
  # to send notifications to the tag manager.)

      Unfortunately, based on your overall course score of %s%%, you did not
      receive a sufficiently high score to obtain a certificate of completion.
      We encourage you to review the lessons noted and to attempt the
      assessment again before it closes. Certificate or not, we hope you
      enjoyed taking the course and learned new skills!
